### How to render .pdf from .tex file:

1. Make sure you've installed latex and python.
2. Run in cmd/terminal: `python compile.py $(filename)`. $(filename) is the name of the .tex file you want to compile without .suffix. For example, here it is `python compile.py midterm`.
3. Windows and Unix file systems have different line breaks. I suggest editing the .tex file on a Unix system.
